# UI

 * Mostly some mix of GUI and CLI. (maybe like AutoCad or Emacs in which people can use commands)
 * Possibly use a 3D mouse to move between windows that overlap each other.
 * Maybe use 3D grids of icons to represent files, icons, etc.
 * Maybe actor based framework.

## Mouse

  * If 3 buttons: select, move and options/menu.
    * E.g. you can't move an object by keeping left clicked, you need to have middle clicked.
